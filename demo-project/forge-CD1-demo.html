    <h1> A bit about me!</h1>
    <p class="paragraph1">

        Ciao, my name is Danielle Quaye and I am from Ghana! Currently, I am a student of Mount Holyoke College. I
        really love spicy food so something I would definitely go for is Ghanaian food. My love for seafood prevails
        and I
        love shrimp in particular.

    <ul>
        <p> A list of my hobbies are:</p>
        <li> Love playing tennis</li>
        <li> Love watching Formula 1 and motorsports in general. The aerodynamics, weight and feel of the car is
            impeccable. Look at the F1 calender for 2025 <a href="https://www.formula1.com/en/racing/2025"> here</a>
        </li>
        <li> Love playing The Sims. Been playing it for sometime now and the mods keep getting better</li>
        <li> Love to travel as well</li>
    </ul>
